## **Thumbnail Generation Api**

Below is the original code I used for generating thumbnails in the AnimeDex project. No modifications have been made to this code.

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Adjust Domain Routes:**
   - You'll need to update the domain routes used in the code to match your specific environment. Make sure they point to the correct endpoints or services.

2. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the following components:
     - **thumbgenjs:** Deploy it on Cloudflare Workers.
     - **thumbgenpy:** Deploy it on a Flask-supported platform, such as Vercel.

Remember that this code is provided as-is, and there will be no further updates from my side. Feel free to experiment with it and adapt it to your needs!
